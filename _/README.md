# Cross-platform Desktop Application Development: Electron, Node, NW.js, and React
This is the code repository for [Cross-platform Desktop Application Development: Electron, Node, NW.js, and React](https://www.packtpub.com/web-development/cross-platform-desktop-application-development-electron-node-nwjs-and-react?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781788295697), published by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/?utm_source=github). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the book from start to finish.
## About the Book
Building and maintaining cross-platform desktop applications with native languages isn’t a trivial task. Since it’s hard to simulate on a foreign platform, packaging and distribution can be quite platform-specific and testing cross-platform apps is pretty complicated.In such scenarios, web technologies such as HTML5 and JavaScript can be your lifesaver. HTML5 desktop applications can be distributed across different platforms (Window, MacOS, and Linux) without any modifications to the code.


## Instructions and Navigation
All of the code is organized into folders. Each folder starts with a number followed by the application name. For example, Chapter02.



The code will look like the following:
```
{
  "name": "file-explorer",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "",
  "main": "main.js",
  "scripts": {
  "test": "echo "Error: no test specified" && exit 1"
},
  "keywords": [],
  "author": "",
  "license": "ISC"
}
```

To build and run the examples in this book, you need either Linux or macOS; you will also
need npm/Node.js. At the time of writing, the author tested the examples with the
following software:

* npm v.5.2.0
* node v.8.1.1
* Ubuntu 16.04 LTS, Windows 10, and macOS Sierra 10.12
